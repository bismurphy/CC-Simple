The 3v3_FILT rail powers many pins on the CC1110. This rail has 8 capacitors on it, many of which are bypass caps on particular pins.
Here is a list of how they exist on the OpenLST:

C1: 0.1 uF, bypass on pin 10 (DVDD)
C2: 220pF, bypass on pins 25 and 26 (AVDD)
C3: 0.1 uF, bypass on pin 28 (GUARD)
C5: 0.1 uF, bypass on pin 29 (AVDD_DREG)
C7: 220 pF, bypass on pin 19 (AVDD)
C10: 0.1 uF, bypass on pin 2 (DVDD)

C47: 1 uF, main supply filtering
C9: 1 uF, main supply filtering.

The AVDD pins (25+26, 19) got the lower 220 pF capacitance. This actually matches the TI Reference Design.

I'm really not using the analog pins, so I'm going to change all those caps to 0.1 uF 0603's.m
